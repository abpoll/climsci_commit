# Climate Research Transparency and Openness Commitments

## Overview
This repository hosts a Markdown file that lists commitments that individuals can make to promote transparency and openness in climate research. The initial commitments are a starting place that we hope a community of users can interact with to contribute to more actionable and meaningful commitments that improve the credibility of climate research. Please feel free to signal your agreement with any of these commitments, or all of them, by signing a reference to the latest persistent and unique archived version of these commitments on your manuscripts, webpages, CVs, and anywhere else you feel it is appropriate. Please also feel free to post issues to start conversations, fork this repository, suggest and implement edits, and help foster a strong community around transparent climate research.
